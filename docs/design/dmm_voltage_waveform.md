# DMM Voltage Waveform

The DMM voltage waveform is an overlay inside the existing multimeter AC/DC
voltage modes. It uses the multimeter voltage frontend routed to the COM and
V/Ohm/C jacks, not the oscilloscope CH1/CH2 inputs.

## Scope

- Enabled only for meter submodes `0` (DC voltage) and `1` (AC voltage).
- Other stock multimeter functions keep their existing UI and acquisition
  paths: resistance, continuity, diode, capacitance, temperature, and current.
- Capacitance remains a DMM mode, selected through the meter mode sequence, and
  is not part of this waveform overlay.

## Data Path

The decoded numeric DMM reading still comes from the USART2 meter frames. Those
frames arrive only a few times per second, so they cannot be used to reconstruct
a 50/60 Hz sine, inverter step waveform, or dimmer chop shape. They remain the
authoritative calibrated value shown in large digits.

The waveform shape is based on the stock-documented SPI3 acquisition case 5
(`METER_ADC_READ`), which is documented as a single-byte meter ADC read. The
firmware polls this candidate raw-sample path at the FreeRTOS tick rate while
the multimeter is in AC/DC voltage mode and stores the samples in a small ring
buffer.

Hardware validation must prove that repeated `METER_ADC_READ` polls while the
meter voltage frontend is active really return raw-enough DMM-path samples from
the COM + V/Ohm/C jacks. If they instead return a filtered/decimated DMM value,
then this feature cannot truthfully draw multi-hertz waveform shape from the
DMM path and must remain blocked rather than falling back to CH1/CH2 scope
inputs.

The USB debug shell commands used for validation are:

- `meter dump [delay_ms]`: parsed DMM/UI state, raw 12-byte frame, decoded BCD,
  decimal position, unit, frame[6] history, companion `aux_freq_i10`, and
  waveform sample count.
- `meter stream [count] [delay_ms]`: compact decoded-frame stream for watching
  range/decimal instability without mixing concurrent serial readers.
- `meter wave`: waveform buffer stats, SPI3 meter-ADC diagnostics, and the
  decoded DMM reading.
- `meter wave path [direct|preacq]` and `meter wave selector [auto|0|1]`:
  explicit diagnostics for the candidate DMM waveform SPI path.
- `mode meter [submode] [layout]`: switch the UI and FPGA frontend to a DMM
  submode from USB before capturing evidence.

The host helper `scripts/openscope_live_debug.py` can run those commands once
or poll them into a log without needing a terminal emulator.

The module has a narrow scaling abstraction for v1 calibration:
`meter_voltage_wave_scale_from_dmm_rms()` derives raw-count-to-volt scaling from
the decoded DMM RMS voltage, keeping the numeric DMM reading authoritative.
Later factory-table calibration can replace that scale source without changing
the UI renderer.

## Rendering

The full DMM voltage layout keeps the large numeric reading and bar graph, then
draws a compact waveform panel below them:

- The trace is auto-scaled to the raw min/max in the sample buffer.
- A faint envelope shows the recent raw range so clipped or noisy shapes do not
  disappear when the synced trace window is short.
- Frequency is estimated from zero crossings when a stable AC shape is present.
  In the live AC mains frame shape captured on 2026-06-05, bytes `[10..11]`
  also alternate around `0x0031/0x0032`, which is exposed as a narrow empirical
  `aux_freq_hz` hint for sync. This is not yet stock-proven metadata.
- AC voltage mode shows an approximate `P-P~` value by scaling the raw peak span
  against the decoded DMM RMS reading.
- DC voltage mode labels the panel as ripple shape; the numeric DC reading
  remains the calibrated measurement.

This feature is a visual aid for ripple and waveform shape on the DMM voltage
jacks. It is not a calibrated oscilloscope replacement.

## 2026-06-05 Live Status

Official V1.2.0 firmware was downloaded from FNIRSI's published Shopify CDN
bundle as `APP_2C53T_V1.2.0_251015.bin`:

- size: `751232` bytes
- sha256: `a17c5c35c97bb898f15672a1747bc1041d8ed507c16999ddba0d1e4e2ec0c760`

`analyzeHeadless` was not available on the bench host, so this pass used the
existing Ghidra decompile plus fresh `arm-none-eabi-objdump` disassembly of the
downloaded binary. The stock ACV case in `meter_mode_handler` branches from the
TBB table to `0x08037228` and reads `frame[7]` bit 0 to select the ACV decimal
state. The pass did not prove that ACV frames use `[10..11]` as a companion
frequency field; stock frequency-unit paths exist elsewhere in the DMM FSM, but
that is different evidence.

Current custom firmware now ports the stock DMM display-state machine into
`meter_data.c` and translates its display format/unit outputs into the local
renderer fields. For ACV, this means it uses the stock `frame[7]` format
selector instead of using `extra` as a range hint:

- `frame[7] bit0 set` maps to stock ACV format index `0`, rendered locally as
  `X.XXX V`.
- `frame[7] bit0 clear` maps to stock ACV format index `1`, rendered locally
  as `XXX.X V`.

After flashing the full-FSM port, the live unit produced stable
`227.5..227.8 V` readings with `aux_freq_i10=490`, matching Georgian mains at
about 50 Hz. The `aux_freq_i10` value is still empirical live metadata from
`[10..11]`; it is not used to select the voltage range.

The waveform source is still not solved. A post-flash sweep across
`direct/preacq` SPI paths and selector `0/1` showed the candidate sample stream
advancing at about 1 kHz but every sample remained `0xFF`, with `p2p=0` and no
usable DMM-path shape. That blocks claiming the voltage waveform overlay works
on the real COM + V/Ohm/C jacks.
