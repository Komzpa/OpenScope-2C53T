- [Reference Projects](re/reference_projects.md) — pecostm32 FNIRSI hack, EEVblog, open-source tools

## Quick Start

1. Build firmware: `cd firmware && make` (hardware) or `make emu` (emulator)
2. Flash (with bootloader): Settings > Firmware Update > `make flash`
3. Flash (first time / DFU): `make flash-all` (see [README](../README.md) for EOPB0 setup)
4. Emulate: `make renode` (display-only) or `make renode-interactive` (with buttons)
5. Ghidra analysis: `ghidraRun` > Open `ghidra_project/FNIRSI_2C53T`
6. Read [reverse_engineering/ARCHITECTURE.md](../reverse_engineering/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the hardware reference
